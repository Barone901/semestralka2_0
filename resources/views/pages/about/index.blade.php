                    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                        The company was founded in 1999 by Mr. Andrej Horváth as BGS Slovakia s.r.o., initially distributing tools from the German company BGS Technic. Through steady growth and customer trust, we expanded our supplier network to fully serve auto repair shops, tire services, and hand tool retailers. In 2008, we launched our own brand – <strong>Triumf Professional Tools</strong> – and grew to a team of 60 professionals.
